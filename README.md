# Clembs icon pack
## Icons that follow my graphical chart, designed for everyone

For now, there only are 32 icons, but I'm planning to add a lot more.  
As of version 2.0, SVG versions are available [here](https://github.com/Clembs/Clembs-icon-pack/tree/main/SVG).  
Some of these icons are based on [Material Design icons](https://material.io/resources/icons) or [Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery).

### These icons are free to use without credit whatsoever, however please don't steal these and pretend you made them yourself ;)
